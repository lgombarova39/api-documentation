# RC Request API
The RC Request API is a web service that allows paysafecard and Paysafecash business partners to request new RC (reporting criteria) automatically.
<br><br>

The API is a great choice when the business partner:
- Regularly needs to onboard more sub-merchants (simply said, frequently requests new RC)
- Wants to avoid the hassle of files sent by mail
- Wants to receive real time notifications about the status of your RC requests
- Wants to know in real time which RC requests need additional information
- Wants to know in real time when the RC requested are ready for processing

This document reviews the process of how to integrate RC Request functionality in the business partner application. It is intended for users who have experience with programming and web services. 
<br><br>

The API follows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">*RESTful*</a> design principles making it easy to understand and integrate the API.
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture style, consisting of guidelines for creating scalable web services.

RESTful systems typically communicate over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) used by web browsers to retrieve web pages and send data to remote servers.

It also facilitates solid and universally accepted foundations like [*http basic authentication*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), [*http verbs*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods), [*JSON*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and [*CORS*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

The internet connection (e.g. through firewall) must allow secured HTTP connections (HTTPS). 
The necessary API Key for authentication and the callback notification key will be provided by paysafecard. 

## Versioning
Every time there is backwards-incompatible change to the API, a new major version will be released. This major version is part of the URL path.
The current major version is *v1*.

Unless informed by our technical support department that we are dropping support for a particular API version, the business partners do not need to switch API versions.

## Prerequisites
A connection to the RC Request API is successful if the following prerequisites are fulfilled:
- API key for request authentication provided by paysafecard
- Authorization of the server IP address performing the requests (if a 403 error is received when trying to access the service, it is likely that the IP address is not yet allowed to access)
- Content-type: Please make sure that the content type in the HTTP header, when submitting requests, is set to Content-Type: application/json
- Character encoding needs to be in UTF-8

## API key authentication
Every request to the API is authenticated using an API key.
- The value of the **API key needs to be base64 encoded** when transmitted in the HTTP header!
- Set the key as the username. [*HTTP basic authentication*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
- Your API key may only be used from your backend systems.
- *Please note: Your API key must be kept secured - never expose the API key to anybody!*

# Group RC Request API Process
This section describes in detail the technical process of an RC request.

1. The business partner initiates the RC request: POST call [*request rc*](#request_rc)

    1.1. paysafecard validates the request and answers immediately with http 200 and status "received" 

1. paysafecard initiates the internal process for a new RC request

1. Once the internal process is completed and the RC is ready to be used, paysafecard updates the business partner with the RC status "approved", using the `callback_url` url provided in the [*request rc*](#request_rc) call

    3.1. If paysafecard needs more information before completing the request, paysafecard updates the business partner with the RC status "pending". In this case the business partner must contact [psp.support@paysafe.com]() with the RC name.

1. *(optional)* The business partner checks the status of the RC request with a GET request.

# Group RC Request API Information
The following section provides additional information about the API.

## API limits
- A maximum of 50 RC can be requested in a single call

    "param": "submerchants[0].id"
    }
   
```

In case of any technical issues or questions regarding API, [techsupport@paysafecard.com]() should be contacted.

# Group Callback notification
<a name="callback_notification"></a> The *callback notification* is an HTTP `POST` request sent to the business partner `callback_url` provided in the [*request rc*](#request_rc) call, immediately and everytime the status of an RC is updated by paysafecard.

The business partner server must respond with *HTTP 200* and the authenticity of the callback notification should be verified.

<br><br>

During the RC Request API integration, the paysafecard team will provide a public key to the business partner which can be used to verifiy the authenticity of the callback notification.

<br><br>

In case of technical errors (e.g. socket timeout) or application errors, the callback notification is resubmitted at a regular interval of 1 minute until one of the following criteria is fulfilled:
- The notification is successfully delivered (i.e. HTTP 200 response from payment server).
- The maximum number of retry attempts has been reached (currently configured to 5 retries).

# Group How to verifiy the Callback notification
The callback notification is signed with "rsa-sha256" and the signature can be found in the HTTP "Authorization" header.

<br><br>
### HTTP headers

### payload
```http
{
    "submerchants": [
        {
            "id": "rc01",
            "status": "approved",
            "mids": [
                "1000000007",
                "1000000008",
                "1000000009"
            ]
        },
        {
            "id": "rc02",
            "status": "pending",
            "reason_text": "The merchant needs to add a product description."
        },
        {
            "id": "rc03",
            "status": "declined",
            "reason_text":"Website is not fully operational."
        }
    ],
    "request_id": "psc_subid_e8P1asjSI8Gz4S60RwR6"
}
```

<br><br>
The signature is created as follows:
```
signature = base64encode(rsa_encrypt(sha256(payload), privateKey))
```
And it is verified as follows:
```
rsa_decrypt(base64decode(signature), publicKey) == sha256(payload)
```

<br><br>
### Using the *[openssl dgst](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/dgst.html)* function to verify the signature

The digest functions can be used to verify digital signatures using message digests. The three steps below ilustrate how this can be done:

1. Extract the public key from the rsa key file sent with the data package
    ```
    openssl rsa -RSAPublicKey_in -in webhook_signer_MANXXXXXXXXXX_1.rsa -out webhook_signer_MANXXXXXXXXXX_1_extracted.pem
    ```

2. Decode the signature of the webhook notification with base64
    
    Linux: ```base64 --decode signature.txt > signature_debase64.txt```
    
    Windows: ```certutil.exe -decode signature.txt signature_debase64.txt```
    
3. Verify the signature using the *[openssl dgst](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/dgst.html)* function

    The generic name, dgst, may be used with an option specifying the algorithm to be used. The default digest is sha256.
    
    ```
    openssl dgst -sha256 -verify webhook_signer_MANXXXXXXXXXX_1_extracted.pem -signature signature_debase64.txt plaintext_payload.txt
    ```

    |Parameter                                                      |Description    |
    |---                                                            |---                                                                 |
    |`-verify webhook_signer_MANXXXXXXXXXX_1_extracted.pem`         |Verifies the signature using the public key extracted in step 1. The output is either `Verification OK` or `Verification Failure`. |
    |`-signature signature_debase64.txt`                            |The actual signature to verify in plain text, obtained in step 2.  |
    |`plaintext_payload.txt`                                        |The body of the payload in plain text.  |
